ADB over network:

- Recent versions of Android added whitelist support for ADB connections, but triggering the
  "allow this computer" dialog still requires a USB connection. So, everybody who wants to push
  stuff to the Q has to connect via USB first.

- The "ADB over network" option gets reset when the Q is rebooted, and will have to be re-enabled
  manually.

- Connect to the Q with adb connect XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (Use 'disconnect' in the same fashion when
  needed) Port 5555 is the default, which the Q is already setup to use. If successful, you'll see
  the Q as a connected device via adb devices

One interesting problem I've run into is the inability to cleanly shut down the Q, as it has no
power button, and all the normal adb 'shutdown' commands don't perform the proper cleanup. The best
thing I've found so far is:

  adb shell input keyevent 26

Until something easier turns up we should try to use this whenever shutdown is needed, or the
filesystem is going to eventually suffer. (Maybe add a real shutdown option to Fridgeface)
